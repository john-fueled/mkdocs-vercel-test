# Demo

This is an example MkDocs project deployed to Vercel.

## Project Structure

Vercel can connect to a Github repository and deploy the contents based on a given subfolder within the repository.

This project contains the `documentation` subfolder where the MkDocs content and config files live.

Vercel automatically detects the contents of this repository, runs `pip install` and the `mkdocs build`, in order to generate the pages that will be hosted.

## Github Repository

This sample repository can be found here: [https://github.com/john-fueled/mkdocs-vercel-test](https://github.com/john-fueled/mkdocs-vercel-test)

Optional: Toggle the "Include source files outside of the Root Directory in the Build Step" off if you only need the contents in `/documentation`.

## Vercel Preview Links

When a PR is open, Vercel will also build a preview link of the documentation.
